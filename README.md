## Deployment


## Instructions

1. Go to your `/section-07/project` folder and run this command
`git clone https://github.com/loveliiivelaugh/nu-group-project-1.git`

2. Open the project in VScode.

3. On line 161. Uncomment `getMeals()`.

4. Save. Then comment it out again. Save again. Refresh your browser page.

*I have this set up this way so that you can save the returned recipe results in your local storage instead of continually make calls to your API, which can cost money or impose restrictions*

5. Once your page refreshes you should see the recipe data populate to the page. From here you can easily see all the data the API is returning.

6. Looking in `/script.js`. There is already a lot of pre written code. From line 165 and beyond is all code that has to do with the authentication flow.

## Todo's
### JavaScript

1. Add full screen windows and window transitions for all 3 auth pages.

2. Fix bug thats preventing the pages from updating when they are supposed to instead of hard refreshing to see when auth and favorites list has been updated etc...

3. Remove duplicates from Favorites list.

4. Update to make use of session tokens when logged in as well as input validation and session validation

### HTML

1. Needs pseudo code, original plan and layout.

2. All html elments still need to be written.

### CSS

1. Using Materialize styling library. Establish layout.

2. Apply Materialize styling to components.
